# Thinking Ahead: GitHub As Career Differentiator

## Learning Goals

- Discuss tips about how to get or keep your GitHub profile ready for job-seeking

## Introduction

GitHub isn't just a repository for code. It's also one of the most important
"calling cards" for those seeking work in software development. Based on
_**numerous**_ feedback sessions with employers we **know** that they look at
these criteria when given a candidate's GitHub profile.

Even though you might not be planning to look for a job right now, following
good hygiene _as you start_ is easier than dealing with a pile of dishes in the
sink _later_. Try to embrace good hygiene as you go because you don't want to be
daunted by cleanup while also looking for a job. You never know when a
prospective employer is peeking in the kitchen, whether solicited or not! And if
solicited, **expect** them to take a look at your "kitchen."

Your GitHub profile isn’t just a portfolio of your code — it’s another part of
your online presence, and arguably the most specific tool a hiring manager has,
without talking to you, for understanding how you are as a candidate. Think hard
about what employers will see on your GitHub profile, and make your profile
stand out.

## Discuss Tips about How to Get or Keep Your GitHub Profile Ready for Job-Seeking

### 1. Pin Projects to the Top of Profile

- __Highlight your most impressive, large and/or recent projects.__ This can
include Flatiron School projects as well as solo projects. Pin them to the top
of your GitHub page.

- __Make your projects diverse.__ Having projects using different languages or
technologies will show that you possess a variety of skills. Draw attention to
repositories that represent this variety by customizing your pinned repositories
accordingly (you can do this through the ‘customize your pinned repositories’
link).

### 2. Add Project Descriptions and Tags

- __Every project should have a description.__ Descriptions should include a few
sentences about functionality, languages and/or major tools used. Be concise
while explaining what the project is about. Have a small, one-sentence
description. They should also include a link to a live site (at one point or
another every final project should be hosted). If your live site is buggy or
temporary, make sure to video a demo of yourself using the project before the
site comes down, and add that instead of a live link. Descriptions can be
added/edited on the project repo.

### 3. Add a README for Every Project

- __All projects should have a README.__ This can include wireframes or videos
demonstrating app design and/or functionality. This differs from a
description as it should be longer, and more detailed about app
functionality. (Gifs are highly recommended.) READMEs can also include links
to live apps. If the Front End and Back End are broken into separate repos,
provide a link to the other relevant portion. If you wrote a blog post about
your project, link it here. READMEs can be added/edited on each project
repo.

### 4. Complete Your Profile

- __Fill out _all_ profile information.__ This includes:
  - Full Name
  - Bio (if nothing else, Full Stack Web Developer)
  - URL (to something! blog, personal portfolio, etc., preferably something with
  contact info) Email (personal choice)
  - Company (FIS)
  - Location (Recruiters use search tools and filter out profiles based on
  location, so having this information on your profile makes it easy for them
  to find you.)
  - Picture (Keep it professional, similar to what you would do on LinkedIn.)

### 5. Commit Often

- __Make consistent contributions to your GitHub profile.__ Think GREEN BOXES!
Your daily activity will show potential employers your level of activity
each day, week, month - and commits should be frequent! Employers look for
this.

### 6. Contribute to Open Source Projects

- __Be a Contributor.__ This shows that you can work well with a community, you
know how to dive into large codebases and you can adapt to different coding
standards. Also, having pull requests/issues/reviews visible on your profile
makes you stand out.

### 7. If You Fork Code, Actually Work on It

- __Create meaningful contributions to other people’s code.__ If you want to
note a fork to return to later, delete the fork, but star the repo it came
from. Your GitHub should communicate that you can build purposeful,
meaningful apps and features. Companies are interested in what you are
capable of creating, not that you completed a lesson; avoid arbitrarily
pinning forked Learn.co lessons.

### 8. Focus on Project Structure and Organization

- __Make sure it is easy to figure out where to go in the project to locate the
various functional areas and layers.__ Use relevant and well known design
patterns/file structure.

### 9. Display Clean, Easy-to-Read Code

- __Make it your code clear to read and understand.__ Functions should be
responsible for one thing in general. Your code should be modular and DRY
(‘Don’t Repeat Yourself’). Keep methods small, and create a chunk you can
reuse in different places and stack in different orders. Stay away from
‘copy and paste.’
 
## Bonus Tips
 
### Are There Tests?

- Building out tests is impressive, especially at a junior level. [Check out
this article](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters)
for tips on how to write testable code and why it matters.

### Are There Comments on Code?

- In a great code base, you’ll see a line about each code before writing the
method, giving a description of what it does. On your next big project start
adding in comments. This will prepare you for working on a common code base at
your future developer gig, and demonstrate to employers that you’re ready to
collaborate effectively.

## Conclusion

As you create and work on coding projects, keep in mind how you organize and
display them, so that you're ready to show them off when you need to.
